# A Polling App Made in Python #

As part of any learning experience, the best way to learn is to do (At least in my eyes). This repository contains the progress of my first Django project repository.

## Future Improvements ##

Despite following a tutorial for this application, there are many ways I could attempt to improve it:
- Allow users to submit Questions on site
- Display bar graph plotting user results
- More tests to cover other views
